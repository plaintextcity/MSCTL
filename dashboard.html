<p>"The	CA	SHALL	host	test	Web	pages	that	allow	Application	Software	Suppliers	to	test	their	software	with	
Subscriber	Certificates	that	chain	up	to	each	publicly	trusted	Root	Certificate.		At	a	minimum,	the	CA	SHALL	
host	separate	Web	pages	using	Subscriber	Certificates	that	are	(i)	valid,	(ii)	revoked,	and	(iii)	expired."

<p>The Trustability Dashboard is using the "Valid" web pages hosted by the CAs.  Not all of these are working (SHA1), not all are available.
Ideally the "Valid" web page would demonstrate CA's example of the security their certificates provide, including SSLLabs A+,
especially with HTTP Strict Transport and HTTP Public Key Pinning (HPKP) to the root being tested (not cross certification).
